The repository contains some of my code I have written recently.

# PHP
In the PHP folder you can see a few controllers of my biggest passion project built on Laravel.

# ES6
In the MERN folder there is a small project where you can see an app that has three small asptects. It was really just a practice project, so it has no real purpose. I dont get to use this stack at work, so I started it at home after work. The root folder is Node back-end, and the front-end is in the client folder which is built with React.
